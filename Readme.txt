# UltraSonic-Alarm
Arduino project 

In the main folder you can find two folders: one for the server and another one for the client.
The project is thought for the ultrasonic sensor to point against a door or a wall and when a it finds out an anomaly in the distance computed it sends a warning message to the server. The server reads the message and it sends it on telegram by Bot. 

Every Folder contains a document with the description and a scheme of the circuit.
